example_text_2 = """Silver half dimes had been struck from the early days of the United States Mint in the late 18th century. 
   Those disappeared from circulation, along with most other coins, in the economic turmoil of the Civil War. 
   In 1864, the Mint successfully introduced low-denomination coins, whose intrinsic worth did not approach their face value. 
   Industrialist Joseph Wharton advocated coins containing nickel—a metal in which he had significant financial interests. 
   When the Mint proposed a copper-nickel five-cent piece, Congress required that the coin be heavier than the Mint had 
   suggested, allowing Wharton to sell more of the metal to the government. """

example_text_4 = """ An explosion at an industrial park in China's Sichuan province has left 19 people dead and 12 others injured, officials say. 
   In a statement quoted by Reuters, the authorities in Jiang'an county said the blast happened at a chemical plant run by Yibin Hengda Technology. 
   Photos on Chinese social media showed a huge fire and plumes of smoke rising from the facility. It is not clear what caused the explosion. 
   According to Xinhua the fire, which broke out on Thursday evening, had been put out early on Friday. Those injured in the blast were in a stable condition. 
   Authorities have begun an investigation, the news agency said. Yibin Hengda makes chemicals for the food and pharmaceutical industries. 
   According to local media reports, the three-storey buildings of the factory burnt down to their steel frames and nearby buildings had their windows shattered.
    The accident follows previous high-profile disasters at chemical plants in China. In 2015, 173 people died in an explosion at a chemical warehouse in the north-eastern port city of Tianjin. 
   An official investigation into the blast found that corruption, political connections and official collusion allowed corners to be cut and safety systems to be overridden."""

   The Israel Defense Forces said warplanes had struck nine rocket launch sites in Gaza on Tuesday in addition to targeting a tunnel system in northern Gaza, several residences of Hamas commanders and an anti-tank squad in Gaza City. 
   The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said 213 people, including 61 children, had been killed and 1,400 others injured in the current round of violence. 
   More than 2,500 Palestinians are now without homes and more than 38,000 are considered internally displaced, according to the United Nations. 
   Israel briefly allowed trucks carrying international aid into Gaza for the first time since the conflict began last week, but Israeli authorities halted the entrance of aid trucks in response to mortar fire at two border cross crossings. 
   Monday night and early Tuesday morning had brought a brief respite in southern Israel from militants' rockets. 
   The Israel Defense Forces did not report any warning sirens overnight, the first time in a week Israel went a night without rocket fire from Gaza. 
   The attacks resumed later Tuesday, with one mortar killing two civilians at an agricultural packaging factory on the Israeli side of the Gaza border, bringing the total number of dead in Israel to 12 since violence erupted just over a week ago. 
   Sirens also sounded once again Tuesday in Ashkelon and other towns, sending residents fleeing again into shelters."""
